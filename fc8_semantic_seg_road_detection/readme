# Semantic Segmentation
### Introduction
We are trying to label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN8).

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You may also need [Python Image Library (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) for SciPy's `imresize` function.

##### Dataset
-Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from (http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip). 
Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.
-Download vgg from https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/vgg.zip and unzip inside the same data folder 

### Start
git clone <repo_link>
##### 

##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
